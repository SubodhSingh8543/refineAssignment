## Refine Assignment

## About

Our Admin Panel Application incorporates the following key components:

- **daisyUI**: An essential component in our project, daisyUI is a TailwindCSS-based library that streamlines the styling of React components. It provides an extensive range of semantic class names derived from regular TailwindCSS classes, making styling more intuitive and efficient. With daisyUI, we've been able to enhance the visual appeal of our application while maintaining clean, readable code.

- **refine**: At the core of our application lies refine, a powerful React framework tailored for building low-code applications. refine simplifies complex tasks such as data management, authentication, and access control, allowing us to focus on delivering functionality without getting bogged down in implementation details. Its seamless integration with backend systems and UI frameworks has been instrumental in the development of our admin panel.

## Chart Functionality

One of the primary features of our Admin Panel Application is its robust chart functionality. We've implemented a functional line chart module that enables users to compare annual data with previous years effortlessly. Key highlights of our chart functionality include:

- **Modularity**: We've adopted a modular, component-based structure for our chart module, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Each component is designed with reusability and scalability in mind, allowing for seamless integration into various parts of our application.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS, we've applied sleek and visually appealing styles to our charts, ensuring a cohesive and professional look across the entire application. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach has enabled us to customize every aspect of our charts with ease, from colors and fonts to sizing and spacing.
